## Malaysian Tax Forms

### What is SST filing?

SST (Sales and Service Tax) is Malaysia's indirect tax. If your business is SST-registered, you must file SST returns (typically every 2 months) with RMCD. CukaiPro helps you track SST liabilities and prepare filing data.

EA (Employment Income) Form is the annual statement of remuneration employers must issue to employees by 28 Feb. It shows salary, allowances, and deductions for income tax.

Form B is the income tax return for businesses (partnerships, sole proprietors). It reports business income, allowable expenses, and tax payable. Filing is due by 30 June (or extended).
